# Jumping Game

Welcome to the Jumping Game repository !

## Description
I developed Jumping Game, a 2D game, using vanilla JavaScriptâ€”no libraries or frameworks involved. The process of envisioning its behavior, crafting algorithms, and animating elements was both enjoyable and educational.

This project served as an engaging entry point into game development, allowing me to enhance my JavaScript skills while bringing a design to life in the form of an animated, functional game.
