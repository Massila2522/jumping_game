# Jumping Game

Welcome to the Jumping Game repository !

## Description
I developed Jumping Game, a 2D game, using vanilla JavaScriptâ€”no libraries or frameworks involved. The process of envisioning its behavior, crafting algorithms, and animating elements was both enjoyable and educational.

This project served as an engaging entry point into game development, allowing me to enhance my JavaScript skills while bringing a design to life in the form of an animated, functional game.

## How to Play

### Controls

- **Arrow Up:** Make the player jump in place.
- **Arrow Left/Right:** Move the player to the left/right. If the player reaches the limit of the land, they will fall.
- **Space Key + Arrow Left/Right:** Make the player jump to another land on the left or right.

### Gameplay

- **Collect Stars:** Navigate the player to collect stars falling from the top.
- **Avoid Thorns:** Be cautious! Touching a thorn will result in losing the game.
- **Background Movement:** The background moves, so ensure the player stays within the visible area. If the player goes out of bounds, it's game over.

### Game Over

When the game ends:
- The score (number of stars collected) is displayed on the screen.
- The distance traveled by the player is also shown.
