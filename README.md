# Jumping Game

Welcome to the Jumping Game repository !

**Play the game [here](https://massila2522.github.io/jumping_game/)**

## Description
I developed Jumping Game, a 2D game, using vanilla JavaScriptâ€”no libraries or frameworks involved. The process of envisioning its behavior, crafting algorithms, and animating elements was both enjoyable and educational.

This project served as an engaging entry point into game development, allowing me to enhance my JavaScript skills while bringing a design to life in the form of an animated, functional game.

# Usage
To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Alternatively, you can play the game directly [here](https://massila2522.github.io/jumping_game/).

# Features
* Object oriented programming with JavaScript
* Write JavaScript code from scratch with no frameworks and no libraries
* Timing and timestamps
* Incorporating diverse backgrounds, each with its lands
* Sprite animations
